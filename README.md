🥫 Edmonton Food Drive Project
A data-driven web application built with Python and Streamlit to help visualize, analyze, and optimize community food donation efforts in Edmonton. The project enables users to track donation volumes, map collection routes, and gain actionable insights in real time through an interactive dashboard.

🚀 Features
📊 Real-time Data Visualization: View donation trends, total volumes, and geographic coverage

🗺️ Interactive Route Mapping: Identify high-yield zones and optimize volunteer collection paths

🔍 Donor Insights: Analyze patterns in donation frequency and category types

🧮 Basic Clustering: Group similar donation zones to improve pickup efficiency

🧰 Deployed via Jupyter Notebook: Easily view and update code using Google Colab or local notebooks

🧱 Tech Stack
Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Backend/Data: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebooks

Visualization: Plotly, Streamlit Maps

Deployment: Google Jupyter Notebook (Colab)
